# Classify-FMNIST
- The goal of this project is to create a convolutional neural network to classify
images in the FMNIST data set, which contains 70,000 28x28 color images of 10 different classes of clothing items.

- [Dataset is linked here.](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.datasets.FashionMNIST.html)
- My code correctly classifies the images in the test set around 90% of the time.
- I use the pytorch library for the implementation of this project.
- This is my unique solution to a project created for Mike X Cohen's "A Deep Understanding of Deep Learning" class.
- Much of the code is adapted from this course.
- The notebook has been linked to best preserve the integrity of the experiments and their outputs.
